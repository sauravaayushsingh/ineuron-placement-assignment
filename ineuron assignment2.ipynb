      "source": "Introduction to Python Abstract Classes\nIn object-oriented programming, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. However, you can create classes that inherit from an abstract class.\n\nTypically, you use an abstract class to create a blueprint for other classes.\n\nSimilarly, an abstract method is an method without an implementation. An abstract class may or may not include abstract methods.\n\nPython doesn’t directly support abstract classes. But it does offer a module that allows you to define abstract classes.\n\nTo define an abstract class, you use the abc (abstract base class) module.\n\nThe abc module provides you with the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes.\n\n",

The full-time employees get a fixed salary while the hourly employees get paid by hourly wages for their services.\n\nThe payroll program needs to print out a payroll that includes employee names and their monthly salaries.\n\nTo model the payroll program in an object-oriented way, you may come up with the following classes: Employee, FulltimeEmployee, HourlyEmployee, and Payroll.\n\nTo structure the program, we’ll use modules, where each class is placed in a separate module (or file).\n\nThe Employee class\nThe Employee class represents an employee, either full-time or hourly. The Employee class should be an abstract class because there’re only full-time employees and hourly employees, no general employees exist.\n\nThe Employee class should have a property that returns the full name of an employee. In addition, it should have a method that calculates salary. The method for calculating salary should be an abstract method.\n\nThe following defines the Employee abstract class:",
